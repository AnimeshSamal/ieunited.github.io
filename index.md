      <h3>Freshers</h3>
      <p>The first ever recreational moment after our entry in CET. Ohh,you think any one would have dare to miss it? It went 
         totally with the theme-"ALOHA NOVATO" which is a Hawaiian proverb meaning "Freshely Updated".Yep,it was held of a updated kind of event with so magnanimous decoration and surreal ambiencein the conference hall.Better,don't ask about the uniform. It was no less cassata ice-cream.Beside all contrast such as region,rank,and rest other, we found our soulmates that day.Not just we fell prey to those pranks of seniors but also,we met each other, fake proposed each other (some got real sh*t) and danced and enjoyed a lot.  </p>
